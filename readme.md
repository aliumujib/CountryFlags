### Introduction
Android app that pulls data from https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all.

### Used libraries
**Dagger2** - Dagger2 was used for dependency injection.</br>
**RxJava2** - RxJava2 was used for threading and data stream management.</br>
**Retrofit2** - Network calls</br>
**AndroidKtx** - For cool extensions to Android classes.</br>
**Architecture Components** - For Lifecycle in the presentation layer.</br>
**Mockito** - For mocking test dependencies.</br>
**JUnit** - For Unit test assertions etc.</br>
**Konveyor** - For generating random data for tests.</br>
**Espresso** - For UI testing.</br>


### Process

I decided to use clean architecture and also break down the project into modules, I thought of exploring `Kotlin Flows` extensively but decided otherwise because `RxJava2` is (as at the time of writing more mature for my chosen presentation architecture MVI), I also decided to use different models for each layer of the architecture so I could do some data cleaning and conversion to fit the models into each layer. I wrote interfaces to represent repositories in the domain layer and then wrote `UseCase`s for searching countries and fetching all countries and then wrote tests for the usecases and repositories.

Afterwards I started writing the `data` layer, here I began by writing models for each of the apps entities/data objects and then interfaces that described classes that would interact with the restcountries API e.g ICountriesRemote. I then wrote concrete implementations of all the repositories defined in the `domain` layer with tests.

Finally I started work on the UI layer. I used the MVI architecture supported by `ViewModel` and `RxJava2`. I tested only the ViewModel classes and wrote a small navigation wrapper around the `FragmentManager` API to switch between destinations in the application and used Dagger2 to provide dependencies to the fragments and ViewModels.


### Possible Improvements

I had a lot of fun building this. There are some improvements I intend to make.

- Write more tests for UI. </br>
- Use MockWebServer to test `Remote` layer API calls.</br>
- Improve UI and add a bookmarking feature (just because I can ðŸ™‚).</br>
- Write more Unit tests.


### Build Instructions
- Clone repository.</br>
- Run with Android Studio 4.0 canary 3 and above. </br>
